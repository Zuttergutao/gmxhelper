# gmxlang README

The gmxlang extension was developed for my research of molecular dynamics.
Up to now, this extension can highlight keywords(supported file: `.gro`, `.mdp`, `.itp`,`.top`, `.pdb`, `.ndx`, `.xvg`, `.fasta`, `.mol2`) and provide snippets for `.mdp`fileã€‚

Additionally, code formatting features `.mdp` and `.gro` were supported.

Detailed information on amino acids is provided as a hover when opening the `fasta` file. 

Detailed information on parameters is provided as a hover when opening the `mdp` file. 

Now, Section Folding is supported!

## Features

The `gmxhelper` extension is a vscode extension to generate regular mdp files and highlight the syntaxes.

Now this extension supports the following file types:

- .top
- .mdp
- .gro
- .itp
- .pdb
- .xvg
- .ndx
- .mol2
- .fasta
